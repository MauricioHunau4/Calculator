Technologies used:
  1. HTML for the structure
  2. CSS for styling
  3. JavaScript for functionality

Features:
  - Basic arithmetic system
  - The numeric pad is available to use
  - Can use numbers with decimals
  - Adition, subtraction, multiplication and division
  - Has ON/OFF function to turn it on and off
  - DEL function to delete the count that you are doing
  - ANS to keep the previous answer
  
How ir works?
  JavaScript is in charge of the main functionality, that is the basic arithmetic.
  I kept all the digits in a variable where everytime it saves, the number pops up in the screen, then you can choose what operation you want to do, also the second number. Finally when you press equal and the result will apear.
  Keep in mind all the details that needs to be carefull, such as not divide by 0, having just one "." when you are going to do numbers with decimals. The track of the variable answer when you can use it and when you can't and handle the errors that should apear when this details occur.
  
To add in the future
  1. More complex arithmetic, with square root and powers of natural numbers, parenthesis and fractions
  2. A better screen when the numbers appear
  3. A record for the las operations the user did, that can be hidden, next to the calculator
  4. Simplify the code for the reader
